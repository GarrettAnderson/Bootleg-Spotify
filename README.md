## Description

Our motivation for this project was to create an website that pulls from 2 API's to use user data. We wanted the website to mimic something to Spotify. Hence the name Bootleg Spotify. This solves two criteria that we wanted to meet. The first is to be able to reference albums from genius based off the user's artist. The second was to provide a spotify playlist from Spotify based off the user's artist. This can help the user to find additional songs based off the playlist provided will have songs related to the artists genre. Also find all the albums if they wish to explore the artist furtther. In the end we learned to code toghether as a group. Flow through our ideas toghether to create functions to pull the API's. In the end we divided all the html, css and javascript evenly.
